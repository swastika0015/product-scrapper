# product-scrapper

This project implements a solution to scrape all products and accumulate them into an array from an imaginary API with limited results per search. 

## Features
- Fetches products within a specified price range.
- Handles pagination for fetching all products.
- Includes a mock function for testing purposes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>

2. Install dependencies:<br>
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/)<br>
After installing Node.js, navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run the following command to install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm install express

3. Start the API server:
   ```bash
   node mockAPI.js

4. Run the API application:<br>
   Once the API server is running, execute the following command to run the API application:
   ```bash
   node script.js

5. This output will include the total number of products fetched and an array of all the products with their `IDs` and `prices`.

## Testing
For testing purposes, you can modify the mock function parameters or mock the API response to simulate different scenarios.
